**What is Stargazer Framework ?**

Stargazer Framework is an open source system for building an entire hardware-agnostic, massively distributed N-body processing super-cluster from the comfort of your chair.

**Architecture**

Stargazer Framework is built around a hardware-agnostic compute server that can be deployed on just about anything. Live telemetry from manager nodes allow for near-instantaneous workload adjustments, allowing each machine to contribute their best to the cluster.

All computations can be easily modified, allowing for new mathematical models to be easily deployed and shared.
